You can buy now tickets on [EventBrite](//teespring.com/ValleyDevFest2016) and we launched our [T-shirt campaign](//www.bit.ly/ValleyDevFest2016Tickets) too.

### Tickets

* Prices increase as we get closer to the event date, sign-up earlier to save some money
* Students get $5 off of each type of ticket (except the T-shirt)
* Or buy a T-shirt of choice instead

### Conference T-shirts

* You can select different types (long-sleeve, short sleeve, ...)
* T-shirt is a ticket to the conference at the same time
* We won't benefit from the T-shirt but hopefully it'll spread the word
