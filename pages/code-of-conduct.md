## Full Code of Conduct
 
To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, organizers, leads and volunteers at WTM Fresno and GDG Fresno
are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Leads will enforce this code throughout events and meetings.

WTM Fresno and GDG Fresno are dedicated to providing a fun harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, socioeconomic
status, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form. Sexual language
and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks. Members violating these rules may
be sanctioned or expelled from the event / meetup without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof)
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior


## Enforcement

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Any other participants (like exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities) are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a member engages in harassing behaviour, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all members. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event / meetup with no refund.

Event organizers and group leads may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our events and meetups for everyone. We want you to be happy at our events and meetups. People like you make our event a better place.

You can make a report either personally or through email.

* Email Report
    You can make an email report here: [info@gdgfresno.com][1]
* Personal Report
    You can make a personal report by contacting a lead or an organizer.

    When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other organizers to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

    Our team will be happy to help you contact venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
