Google is known all around the world. Everyone is 'Googling', watching "YouTube", checking on 'Maps' and communicating in 'Gmail'. From an end user perspective these are services that just works, but not for us. Developers see much more: Design, APIs, scalability issues, complex technology stacks. And that is what GDG is about.

Google Developers Groups (for example [GDG Fresno][1], [GDG Visalia][2], [GDG Modesto][3], [GDG Sonoma][5], [GDG San Francisco][4], [GDG Berkeley][7], [GDG Silicon Valley][8], [GDG LA][6]) are open and volunteer geek communities who create exciting projects and share experience about Google technologies with a passion. Our goal is to organize space to connect the best industry experts with the audience to boost development of IT.
